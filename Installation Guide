#Starting Steps
[Python (miniconda edition)](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html/)
Select your OS and install miniconda and make sure to check the box asking to delegate minicoda as this PC's python 3.4.

Open `cmd(admistrator mode)` or `terminal(sudo)` and run:

`conda install -c menpo opencv3`

Afterwards check to see if everything's installed:

>`python`
>>`>>import cv2`
>>`>>import numpy`
>>`>>import matplotlib`

Make sure these commands run without any errors. If not, exit python interpretor and run what's missing:

	pip install matplotlib 

### IDE
